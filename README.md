IonToolPack is a software suite for housing tools for mass spectrometry. The first one is PeakQC, a software a tool for automated quality control (QC) of mass spectrometry (MS) data which is is omics-agnostic (works for any ion type, e.g.: metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, etc.), supports various instrument platforms and acquisition modes and has a simple graphical user interface.

## Usage
1. Download the latest version (Release section, right panel) and uncompress it
2. Double click IonToolPack.exe
3. Import raw MS files and click “Process”
4. See more details and examples in PeakQC_User-guide_*.pdf

## MS data supported
Supported formats include Agilent 'd', Bruker 'd' (improvements in progress), Thermo '.raw', and mzML, and for different types of MS acquisition methods:
* LC-MS
* LC-IMS-MS
* With/without fragmentation spectra in DDA or DIA mode
* Direct infusion
